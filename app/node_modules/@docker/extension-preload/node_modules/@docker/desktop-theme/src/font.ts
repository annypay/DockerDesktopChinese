  Why are we exporting here instead of just doing:

  import '@fontsource/open-sans/variable.css';

  Because we don't know (at this point) how this module will
  be used. If our build pipeline ultimately uses style-loader,
  then it will either:

  - by default, just insert the styling into the document, and this
    module will export nothing
  - if configured to do lazy inserting, return a function that can
    be called to add the styles to the document

  The latter use case is why we return the exported value of the CSS
  file.

  This is all weird stuff - packages exporting CSS, not knowing how
  it'll be used. But if we're carefully unopinionated, and just blindly
  export whatever the imported CSS exports, we can make it work.
